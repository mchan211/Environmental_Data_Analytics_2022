## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1. **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom
    + YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    + More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet
2. **R Code Chunks** surrounded by ``` on top and bottom
    + Create using `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    + Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    + Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted
3. **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document



## RESOURCES

Handy cheat sheets for R markdown can be found: [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).

There's also a quick reference available via the `Help`→`Markdown Quick Reference` menu.

Lastly, this [website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) give a great & thorough overview.


## THE KNITTING PROCESS
-   The knitting sequence
    ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)

* Knitting commands in code chunks:
 - `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file
 - `echo = FALSE`    - code not included in knitted file, but results are
 - `eval = FALSE`    - code is not run in the knitted file
 - `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file
 - `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...
 - `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results


## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?
See: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and class recording. 
 * Languages other than R...
 * Various outputs...
 
>Documents
Presentations
Shiny
etc.
 
 *Can also create codechunks that are NOT R - can use Python as well (potentially) --> must have kernels installed (executables) in order to run the code

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WHY R MARKDOWN?

<Fill in our discussion below with bullet points. Use italics and bold for emphasis (hint: use the cheat sheets or `Help` →`Markdown Quick Reference` to figure out how to make bold and italic text).> 

* R **is** --not-- open-use  
* Can utilize _non-R_ code  
  * however, you must have these code kernels __installed__  
* Can create more than just documents - ability to knit to PowerPoint and other types  
  * Easily incorporate plots _and_ graphs within your PowerPoint  
  * Can also include table formatting  
* Creates ease for collaboration due to easy reading format and ability to push/pull through GitHub


## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

```{r leaf litter data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df.leaf.litter <- read.csv("../Data/Processed/NEON_NIWO_Litter_mass_trap_Processed.csv")

leaf.mass <- df.leaf.litter[1:10,3:5]

knitr::kable(leaf.mass, caption = "Leaf Litter Mass (g) - June 2016")

```

## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).
```{r chunk name, specify knitting command}
#can also edit output options in the little tool widget in the upper right corner of chunk
```

```{r install.packages, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#don't want to fully knit in chunks that have install packages function
install.packages('knitr')
```

### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.

```{r setup, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
getwd()
library('tidyverse')
library('lubridate')
library('knitr')
library('dplyr')

mytheme <- theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(mytheme)

```

Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.

```{r load in data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
NTL.LTER <- read.csv("../Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

NTL.LTER$sampledate <- as.Date(NTL.LTER$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y")
  
head(NTL.LTER)

```

Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.


### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

```{r lakes data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
PP.lakes <- read.csv("../Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

PP.lakes.filtered <- PP.lakes %>%
  select(lakename, year4, daynum, month, sampledate, 
         depth, tn_ug, tp_ug, nh34, no23, po4) %>% 
  filter(depth == 0.00) %>%
  filter(!is.na(tn_ug), !is.na(tp_ug), !is.na(nh34), !is.na(no23), !is.na(po4))
  
```

Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

```{r lake nitrogen, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
N.Peter.summary <- PP.lakes.filtered %>%
  filter(lakename == "Peter Lake") %>%
  mutate(Mean.NH34 = mean(nh34),  Min.NH34 = min(nh34), 
        Max.NH34 = max(nh34),  StanDev.NH34 = sd(nh34),
         Mean.NO23 = mean(no23),  Min.NO23 = min(no23), 
         Max.NO23 = max(no23),  StanDev.NO23 = sd(no23), Sum.N = (no23+nh34)) %>%
  select(lakename, depth, sampledate, nh34, no23, Mean.NH34, 
         Min.NH34,  Max.NH34,  StanDev.NH34,
         Mean.NO23,  Min.NO23,  Max.NO23,  StanDev.NO23, Sum.N)

N.Paul.summary <- PP.lakes.filtered %>%
  filter(lakename == "Paul Lake") %>%
  mutate(  Mean.NH34 = mean(nh34),   Min.NH34 = min(nh34), 
          Max.NH34 = max(nh34),   StanDev.NH34 = sd(nh34), 
          Mean.NO23 = mean(no23),   Min.NO23 = min(no23), 
          Max.NO23 = max(no23),   StanDev.NO23 = sd(no23), Sum.N = (no23+nh34)) %>%
  select(lakename,   depth, Mean.NH34, sampledate, nh34, no23,
          Min.NH34,   Max.NH34,   StanDev.NH34,
          Mean.NO23,   Min.NO23,   Max.NO23, StanDev.NO23, Sum.N)
```

```{r lake phosphorus, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
P.Peter.summary <- PP.lakes.filtered %>%
  filter(lakename == "Peter Lake") %>%
  mutate(Mean.PO4 = mean(po4), Min.PO4 = min(po4), 
        Max.PO4 = max(po4), StanDev.PO4 = sd(po4)) %>%
  select(lakename, depth, sampledate, po4, Mean.PO4, 
        Min.PO4, Max.PO4, StanDev.PO4, 
        Mean.PO4, Min.PO4, Max.PO4, StanDev.PO4) 
P.Paul.summary <- PP.lakes.filtered %>%
  filter(lakename == "Paul Lake") %>%
  mutate(Mean.PO4 = mean(po4), Min.PO4 = min(po4), 
        Max.PO4 = max(po4), StanDev.PO4 = sd(po4)) %>%
  select(lakename, depth, sampledate, po4, Mean.PO4, 
        Min.PO4, Max.PO4, StanDev.PO4, 
        Mean.PO4, Min.PO4, Max.PO4, StanDev.PO4)
```

```{r lake nutrient summaries, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
N.PP.summary <- full_join(N.Peter.summary,N.Paul.summary)

P.PP.summary <- full_join(P.Peter.summary,P.Paul.summary)
```

Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

```{r kable, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
N.table <- N.PP.summary[]
knitr::kable(N.table, 
 caption = "Nitrogen content of Peter and Paul Lake")

P.table <- P.PP.summary[]
knitr::kable(P.table, 
 caption = "Phosphorus content of Peter and Paul Lake")

```

Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.
```{r nitrogen plot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
N.PP.summary <- N.PP.summary %>%
  mutate(Year = year(sampledate)) %>%
  mutate(Month = month(sampledate))%>%
  mutate(Date = my(paste0(Month,"-",Year)))%>%
  group_by(Date)
P.PP.summary <- P.PP.summary %>%
  mutate(Year = year(sampledate)) %>%
  mutate(Month = month(sampledate))%>%
  mutate(Date = my(paste0(Month,"-",Year)))%>%
  group_by(Date)

ggplot(N.PP.summary, aes(x=Date, y=Sum.N))+
  geom_line(aes(color=lakename)) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Nitrogen Concentration") +
  labs(title = "Nitrogen Concentrations over Time in Peter and Paul Lake")

ggplot(P.PP.summary, aes(x=Date, y=po4))+
  geom_line(aes(color=lakename),alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Phosphorus Concentration") +
  labs(title = "Phosphorus Concentrations over Time in Peter and Paul Lake")
```

### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?

> From our data wrangling, we see that Peter Lake has an overall higher mean concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus compared to Paul Lake. In particular, Peter Lake's nitrogen concentration is much higher than Paul Lake's - through the Nitrogen concentration plot by lake, we see that Peter Lake's concentrations have higher variability over time. Uniquely, Peter Lake had a huge peak in concentration between 1996-1997, but nitrogen levels decreased to "base levels" by 1998. With phosphorus concentrations, both Peter and Paul lakes have high variability with phosphorus concentrations over time. However, Peter Lake seems to have higher variability in comparison with Paul Lake. Phosphorus concentrations look to cycle through a boom-bust pattern with period of sudden peaks and then a sudden decrease. From 1993-1995, there was a period for Peter and Paul lakes where overall phosphorus levels were lower than previous and future levels. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Moving forward, I would run a time-series analysis to see if there are specific trends within nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in Peter and Paul lakes over time. Next, I may pull for spatial datasets of Peter and Paul lakes and perform a GLM. A question I would like to explore is if the location of Peter and Paul lakes is impacting the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations within each lake. In particular, I would like to see why Peter Lake's concentrations are so much higher than Paul lakes. 

## KNIT YOUR PDF
When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include: 

* Table of contents
* Number sections
* Control default size of figures
* Citations
* Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))

pdf_document:  
    toc: true  
    number_sections: true
