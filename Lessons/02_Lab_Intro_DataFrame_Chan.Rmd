## Data frame definition

A **data frame** is used for storing data tables. It a list a vector of equal length. 

When we import data to R, data frame is the preferred way for storing the data because columns can have different modes (character, numeric, integer, logical, complex).


## Data frame built-in example

Let's look into a built-in data frame from package "datasets" - cars. The data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop.

```{r cars}
cars
```


Note that it has 2 columns and 50 rows.

## Data frame columns

Suppose you want just the column speed. How would you access that data? 

```{r}
cars$speed
```


How would you store it on another object?

```{r}
car_speed <- cars$speed
car_speed
```


## Transforming object in a data frame

Is the new object you create a data frame?
```{r}
#Option 1
class(car_speed)

#Option 2
is.data.frame(car_speed)
```

How could you make it a data frame?

```{r}
df_car_speed <- as.data.frame(car_speed)
df_car_speed
class(df_car_speed)
```

## Adding columns to a data frame

How could you add columns to *df_car_speed*?

```{r}
car_dist <- cars$dist

#Option 1
df <- cbind(df_car_speed,car_dist)  #similarly rows could be added using rbind() - cbind only works if each object has same number of row
class(df)
df

#Or Option 2 - transform into a data frame before binding - binding two data frames together; using data frames in cbind() is better when you are trying to combine matrix/values that are not just one column
df_car_dist <- as.data.frame(car_dist)  #op2
df_opt2 <- cbind(df_car_speed,df_car_dist)
class(df_opt2)
df_opt2

```

Note that when we transformed the vector in a data frame the name of the vector became the column name.

```{r}
colnames(df)  #or simply names()- gives names of columns in data frame; can also be used to rename column names
names(df)
```

## Creating a data frame

How would you create a data frame?

```{r}
#useful function data.frame() - can asign "name" to columns within this function
create_df <- data.frame("speed"=car_speed,"dist"=car_dist)
create_df
```


## Data frame functions

Some useful functions to use with data frames.

```{r}
ncol(df)  
nrow(df)  
length(df)  #same as ncol
summary(df) #only true for numeric variables - stats
head(df) #show the first 6 rows of df
tail(df) #shows last 6 rows of df

#If you know the number of the column you want you can refer to that to access column - format is object[rows,columns]

df_2 <- df[1:10,1:2] #if don't put anything before clumn, r assumes that you want all rows
df_2

#you could also use this notation to delete columns
df <- df[,-2] #the minus sign tells r to remove the 2nd column
df
```
